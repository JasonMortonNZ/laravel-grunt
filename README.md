You can configure many of the settings for this package, by traversing to it's configuration file. This file is located in you project's vendor directory, as below:

	`app/config/packages/jason-morton-nz/laravel-grunt/config.php`

This file is heavily commented, so hopefully each setting should be self explanatory.

### How to use?
So, how do you use this package? Well we've tried to make it as simple as possible. There's just 3 commands:

#### grunt:setup
The `grunt:setup` command is used to setup your required asset + grunt workflow. You use the command as follows:

`php artisan grunt:setup`

The command will ask you a selection of questions, and the rest is all done for you.

#### grunt:build
The `grunt:build` command will run the grunt task runner and lint, compile, minify all your files, according to how you want things done. You use the command as follows:

`php artisan grunt:build`

#### grunt:watch
The `grunt:watch` command is used to start a the grunt file watcher. This will watch for any changes made to your front-end workflow files (CSS, JavaScript, LESS, SASS & Stylus), and will then auto-reload your web browser to reflect those changes. You can use the command as follows:

`php artisan grunt:watch`

**Note:** That live reload will only work if you have a compatible browser (Chrome & Firefox) with the LiveReload plugin installed.

#### bower:setup

You can add a custom path for bowers vendor folder, as well as stipulate all the bower dependencies you require. All this can be done without touching a single line of JavaScript or JSON. You can use the command as follows:

`php artisan bower:setup`
